# CharacterAI Discord Bot

âš¡This project was absorbed by the new **[Character Engine Discord](https://github.com/drizzle-mizzle/Character-Engine-Discord)** bot and is no longer actively supported.<br>
âš¡Please, consider switching to it *(it can do basically all the same things, but more and better)*.<br>
<br><br>
An unofficial Discord integration with a [CharacterAI](https://beta.character.ai/) service which you can use to add any character on your own Discord server.
